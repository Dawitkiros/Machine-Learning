This file contain basics of SET:
    -Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
    -Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data.
    -A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
    -Sets are written with curly brackets.
NB: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

set01 = {"fitsum","misrak","solomon","dawit"}
print(set01)

"""Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear."""
"""Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
Unordered:
    -Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
    -Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
Unchangeable:
    -Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
    -Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.
